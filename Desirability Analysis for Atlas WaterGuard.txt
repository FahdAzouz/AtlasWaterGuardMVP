Value Proposition 
Atlas WaterGuard addresses critical customer needs through: 
1. Water Conservation with Economic Benefits: The unique "Water Credit" system transforms 
conservation into immediate economic value by rewarding farmers with mobile credits 
redeemable for agricultural inputs (drought-resistant seeds, fertilizers). This creates a direct 
link between responsible water usage and financial benefit. 
2. Appropriate Technology Design: A voice-based mobile app accommodates varying literacy 
levels, while solar-powered IoT soil sensors eliminate concerns about electricity access in 
remote areas. 
3. Integration with Existing Systems: By connecting with RAMED and National Land Registry 
systems, the solution integrates into established government frameworks for more equitable 
resource distribution. 
4. Demonstrated Impact: Pilot projects have already shown a 35% reduction in water use for 
citrus farms, providing tangible evidence of effectiveness. 
5. Cost-Effective Solution: Sensors cost 60% less than competitor models, making the 
technology accessible to smallholder farmers with limited resources. 
6. Knowledge Sharing Platform: The farmer forum creates a community for discussing 
agricultural trends and best practices, adding social value beyond the technical solution. 
Customer Relationships 
Atlas WaterGuard will establish and maintain relationships with farmers through: 
1. Personalized Assistance: Initial on-site setup and training will ensure proper installation and

community among users. 
4. Data Feedback Loop: Regular updates with water-saving achievements and credit 
accumulation will reinforce the value proposition. 
5. Government Partnerships: Working through established agricultural extension services to 
build credibility and trust. 
Channels 
Effectively reaching the target market through: 
1. Direct Outreach: Partnering with local agricultural cooperatives and community leaders to 
introduce the solution. 
2. Agricultural Extension Services: Leveraging existing ONCA networks to demonstrate the 
technology to potential users. 
3. Demonstration Farms: Creating showcase installations where farmers can see the technology 
in action before committing.
